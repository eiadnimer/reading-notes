X Links are created using the element. X The element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to. X If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs. X You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field. X You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
- **Positions** 
- position: static 
- position:relative
- Relative URLs: Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.

- Layout Grids Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.
- CSS Frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
