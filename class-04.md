- JavaScript Functions is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
- JavaScript Function Syntax is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
- The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:(Iparameter1, parameter2, etc)
- The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
## Why we use the Functions? ##
- You can Define the code once, and use it many times.
- You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
- JavaScript Objects are variables containers for data values.
- JavaScript Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
