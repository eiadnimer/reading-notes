# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables
- Object is literal notation is basically an array of key:value pairs, with a colon separating the keys and values, and a comma after every key:value pair, except for the last, just like a regular array. Values created with anonymous functions are methods of your object. Simple values are properties. 
- You can create objects using new as a keyword and then use dot notation to add keys.
- You can declare the constructer as you declared functions.
- Literal Notation is the easiest way to create objects
- The **DOM** specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
- **Creating a model in HTML page** 
When the browser loads a web page, it creates a model of the page in memory. The DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using a DOM tree. The DOM is called an object model because the model (the DOM tree) is made of objects.
- We can use DOM to accessing and change the HTML page
- **TABLES**
- Table can represent information in grid way, using columns and rows. Also, it stored information in cells.
- There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows:
1- thead
2- tbody
3- tfoot

- The headings of the table should sit inside the <thead> element.
- The body should sit inside the <tbody> element.
- The footer belongs inside the <tfoot> element.
